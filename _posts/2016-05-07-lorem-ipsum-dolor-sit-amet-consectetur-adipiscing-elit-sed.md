_**Panthers Over Korea**_(2007) is a non fiction account of George Schnitzer's (1929--2010) experiences as a[United States Navy][0]pilot during the[Korean War][1]flying the[Grumman][2][F9F Panther][3][Jet aircraft][4].

> What we did as part of the war was soon forgotten by the nation in general and the war earned the title: The Forgotten War. To those of us who went through the hail of enemy AAA fire, it was never forgotten. Eight of us started out on this adventure; six of us came home alive after flying an average of 150 missions.[\[1\]][5]
